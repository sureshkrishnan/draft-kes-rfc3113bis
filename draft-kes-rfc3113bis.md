--- abstract

This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serve as the basis for the collaboration between 3GPP and IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical specifications, and to facilitate maximum interoperability with existing fixed and mobile Internet systems, devices, and protocols.

# Introduction

The IETF and 3GPP formalized a set of principles and guidelines for co-operation in {{?RFC3113}}. While the high level principles remain intact in the collaboration many of the details in that document have become out of date due to changes in the organizational structures of both IETF and 3GPP as well as in the way the co-ordination activities are conducted in practice. e.g. both the IETF and 3GPP have reorganized and renamed areas so that the RFC3113 contains incorrect and misleading information. The document access mechanisms have also been changed even as the open access principles still remain intact. It is also difficult to keep this information up to date due to the fairly dynamic nature of both of the SDOs. This document intends to reiterate the high level principles of co-operation and the co-ordination mechanisms while leaving out the detailed descriptions to be specified and maintained by the co-ordination function itself.

# Administrative support groups

IAB Administrative Support Groups are groups with dedicated membership, similar to directorates, that act as an arm of the IAB, assisting the IAB in discharging its responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is that the IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the Internet Society in technical liaison relationships with other organizations concerned with standards and other technical and organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet. In 2023, the IAB decided to create an administrative support group to work on the co-ordination activities between IETF and 3GPP.

# IETF-3GPP Administrative Support Group

The purpose of this group is to support coordination activities between IETF and 3GPP. This group is led jointly by the respective liaison managers from both organizations, IETF and 3GPP. This group has no fixed membership, but participation from relevant IETF Area Directors, IETF WG Chairs, 3GPP WG Chairs, and document authors/editors is encouraged. The group co-leads will review and update the mailing list yearly prior to the July meeting, in order to adjust for changes in the IESG and IAB.

# High level principles

As stated in RFC3113, 3GPP has identified the benefit of adopting Internet specifications and the preferred 3GPP approach is to use the Internet standards unchanged, if feasible.  In any case, 3GPP has no intention to duplicate work performed in IETF. While this is the preferred scenario, 3GPP recognizes that additions or modifications might be needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfill the needs of 3GPP, and in such cases, these concerns will be directly brought up at the IETF-3GPP administrative support group to be addressed by the relevant IETF areas and WGs. This document also reiterates the principle that informal communication at working level is encouraged whenever possible, and formal communications are to be used only when deemed necessary.
